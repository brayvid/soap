# SOAP: A New Polling Platform

July 30th, 2024
<h3>Revolutionizing How We Talk About Politicians</h3>

Constructive political criticism online is hard to find. Discussions quickly turn mean, and even minor disagreements can escalate into major arguments. Messages will get lost if one's audience is too small, and misunderstood words can lead to backlash.

That's where Soap comes inâ€”a new platform designed to change the way we talk about politicians. Soap is a public utility disguised as a social network where users can describe officials one word at a time. This straightforward approach aims to foster a thoughtful, concise, and reasonable discourse.

Soap allows users to submit a few words for each official, which are then interpreted as ranked choice votes. This method ensures that the most popular words rise to the top, providing a clear and collective voice of the people.

Users can update their choices at any time, allowing for a dynamic and evolving reflection of public opinion. By limiting the number of words each user can contribute, Soap encourages careful consideration and promotes a more civil discussion environment.

Soap is more than just a social platformâ€”it's a movement towards more constructive discourse about our leaders. Join us in shaping a new way to discuss politics, where every word counts and every voice is heard. Together, we can create a more thoughtful, reasonable, and effective conversation.

## Tech Stack

Soap is built using two primary languages: Node.js for the web server and API, and Python for the image processing pipeline.

### Backend

*   **Runtime:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **Web Framework:** [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is used to handle web page requests, define the API endpoints, and manage real-time connections.
*   **Database:** The application stores its data in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
*   **Database Access:** [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) is used for writing database queries and managing schema migrations.
*   **Real-time Updates:** [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) is used to push data from the server to the browser, allowing for live updates on the politician pages without requiring a user to refresh.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** The [vader-sentiment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vader-sentiment) library is used to determine the valence (positive or negative) of most submitted words in real time. [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) handles cases where vader fails on a scheduled basis.

### Frontend

*   **Languages:** The user interface is built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES Modules).
*   **Development Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used to run a local development server and bundle the frontend assets for deployment.
*   **Data Visualization:** [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is used to render the interactive bubble charts based on word submission data.

### Image Processing & Machine Learning

A separate Python script is responsible for analyzing politician portraits. The Node.js server executes this script for each image.

*   **Core Language:** [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   **Face Analysis:** Google's [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) library detects 478 distinct facial landmarks in a portrait.
*   **Image Manipulation:** The [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library uses the landmark data to crop, resize, and convert the portrait to grayscale.
*   **Numerical Calculation:** [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) does the math to correctly scale and position the landmark coordinates.

### Development and Tooling

*   **Server Auto-Reload:** [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) automatically restarts the backend server during development when files are changed.
*   **Script Execution:** [Concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) runs the frontend and backend processes together with a single command.
*   **Configuration:** The [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) module loads environment variables from a local file.


### Performance & SEO

*   **Server-Side Compression:** The [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) middleware for Express.js is used to Gzip assets, reducing the size of files sent to the browser and speeding up load times.
*   **Asset Bundling:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) bundles and minifies all JavaScript and CSS code for production, creating small, optimized files.
*   **Asynchronous CSS Loading:** Font stylesheets are loaded asynchronously using the `media="print"` technique, which prevents them from blocking the initial rendering of the page.
